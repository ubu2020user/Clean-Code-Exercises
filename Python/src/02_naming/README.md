# Exercise 2: Naming Conventions

## Objective
The goal of this exercise is to analyze, evaluate, and refactor the existing source code to align with proper naming conventions and coding standards.

---

## Tasks

### 1. **Review Coding Conventions**
- Visit the official **Python Style Guide** (PEP 8).
- Review the guidelines provided for writing clean and maintainable source code.

### Task 1: Analyze Naming Violations
- Open the files:
  - [circleData.py](./exercises/circleData.py)
  - [customerData](./exercises/customerData.py)
- Identify naming convention violations (e.g., inconsistent variable names, unclear function names).
- Document your findings.

### Task 2: Refactor Naming
- Refactor the code to:
  - Use meaningful and consistent names for variables, functions, and classes.
    - Use the refactoring functionality of your IDE:
      - Right-click on a name, then select **Refactor >   Rename**.
      - Ensure all names follow proper conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, snake_case for functions in Python).

  - Align with the conventions outlined in the Python Style Guide ([PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)).

## Goals
By the end of this exercise, you should:
- Understand the importance of naming conventions in clean code.
- Be able to identify and correct naming violations.
- Develop skills in using IDE refactoring tools effectively.

Good luck!
