# Exercise 3: Refactoring and Extracting Codeblocks

## Objective
The goal of this exercise is to refactor and extract code blocks to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.

---

## Tasks

### Exercise 1: Analyze Code Structure
- Open the file [shopping.py](./exercises/shopping.py)
- Identify areas where code blocks can be extracted into functions or methods.
- Document your findings, focusing on:
  - Repeated code patterns.
  - Overly complex functions.
- Refactor the code to:
  - Extract reusable code blocks into functions or methods.
  - Ensure each function has a single responsibility and a clear purpose.
  - Use meaningful names for extracted functions, following Python naming conventions (e.g., snake_case for functions).

- Verify that the refactored code aligns with the Python Style Guide ([PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)).

## Goals
By the end of this exercise, you should:
- Understand the importance of extracting code blocks for clean code.
- Be able to identify and refactor complex code structures.
- Develop skills in creating reusable and maintainable functions.

Good luck!
