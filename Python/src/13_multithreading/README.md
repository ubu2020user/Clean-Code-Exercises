# Exercise 13: Multi-threading

## Objective
Experiment with sequential and parallel algorithms to understand their performance differences and runtime behavior.

---

## Tasks

### Analyze and Modify the Search Algorithm
Perform the following tasks to explore the behavior of sequential and parallel search algorithms:

- Experiment with the provided algorithm for sequential and parallel search of a minimum.
- Determine if the parallel algorithm is faster and explain your observations.
- Modify the `find_min_sequential` method to introduce a 1ms sleep in each iteration. Analyze how this affects runtime behavior and explain your findings.
- Experiment with the values `NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS`, `NUMBER_OF_THREADS`, and `PARTITION_SIZE`. Observe how runtime values change and provide explanations for these observations.

## Goals
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Understand the performance differences between sequential and parallel algorithms.
- Learn how small changes in code can impact runtime behavior.
- Develop skills in analyzing and explaining algorithmic performance.

Good luck!
