# Exercise 7: Errors and Exception Handling

## Objective
The goal of this exercise is to explore best practices for handling errors and exceptions in Python, ensuring code robustness and reliability.

---

## Tasks

### Refactor Code for Improved Error Handling
- Open the files in [exercises](./exercises/).
- Analyze the code and address the following:
  - Are there methods that return null values?
  - Are there methods that can accept null values as arguments?
  - Refactor the code so that Optionals are returned instead of null values.
  - Refactor the code so that the IDE alerts the developer if a null value is accidentally passed to a method.
  - Throw an appropriate exception if a null (None) value is still passed.

## Goals
By the end of this exercise, you should:
- Understand how to handle null values effectively in Python.
- Be able to refactor code to use Optionals instead of returning null values.
- Learn techniques to prevent null values from being passed to methods.
- Implement appropriate exceptions to handle unexpected null (None) values.

Good luck!
