## Objective
The goal of this exercise is to practice writing clear and concise docstrings to improve code documentation and readability.

---

## Tasks

### Exercise 1: Add Docstrings to Functions
- Open the files in [exercises](./exercises/)
- Identify functions or methods that lack docstrings.
- Write docstrings for each function, ensuring they:
  - Clearly describe the purpose of the function.
  - Specify input parameters and their types.
  - Detail the return value and its type.
  - Include any exceptions raised by the function.

- Verify that the docstrings follow the Python Docstring Conventions ([PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)).

## Goals
By the end of this exercise, you should:
- Understand the importance of docstrings for code documentation.
- Be able to write effective docstrings for functions and methods.
- Develop skills in adhering to Python documentation standards.

Good luck!
