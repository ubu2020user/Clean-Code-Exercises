# Exercise 1: Noodle Code

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze, evaluate, and improve the existing source code. You should assess the quality of the code, identify weaknesses, and propose improvements.

## Snake Game I
- Open the file [`snake_game.py`](./exercises/snake_game.py) of the folder [`src/01_introduction`](./).
- Test the game and analyze its implementation.
- Identify areas for improvement, such as:
  - **Code readability**: Is the code easy to read and understand?
  - **Structure and organization**: Is the code well-structured and organized?
  - **Documentation**: Are the functions and classes well documented?
  - **Reusability**: Are the functions modular and reusable?
- Make notes via comments in the code to highlight areas that need improvement.

## Snake Game II: Refactoring
- Try to improve the code based on your analysis.
- Refactor the code to:
  - Enhance readability and structure.
  - Improve documentation.
  - Ensure modularity and reusability of functions.
- Document the changes.

## Solutions
For Snake Game I:  
Compare your comments with the file [`snake_game_solution.py`](./solutions/snake_game_solution.py) in the folder `solution`.

For Snake Game II:
Compare your refactored code with the file [`snake_game_refactored.py`](./solutions/snake_game_clean.py) in the folder `solution`.


## Notes
- Use the file `requirements.txt` to install all necessary libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
