# Exercise 11: Injection

## Objective
Implement the `EmployeeService` class to demonstrate dependency injection and enhance code modularity.

---

## Tasks

### Implement the EmployeeService Class
1. Analyze the [Logging Example](./exercises/log/). It shows a specific way of injections via annotations.
2. Analyze the [Employee Classes](./exercises/employees/). 
   - Understand how this injection works. 
   - Create the additional `EmployeeService` class and inject the `EmployeeRepo` into it. It should initialize multiple employees and provide a method to send mails to them.

## Goals
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Understand and apply dependency injection.
- Improve code modularity and design.
- Develop skills in creating services with injected dependencies.

Good luck!
